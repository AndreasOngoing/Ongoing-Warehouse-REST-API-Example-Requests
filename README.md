# Ongoing Warehouse REST API example requests
[Ongoing Warehouse](https://www.ongoingwarehouse.com/) is a Warehouse Management System (WMS).

We provide several [Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://developer.ongoingwarehouse.com/). One of them is [based on REST](https://developer.ongoingwarehouse.com/REST/v1/index.html). In this repository, we provide examples of what the requests and responses look like.

These examples will show you how to:
* Create and update articles (including attaching files to articles).
* Create and update orders (including attaching files to orders).
* Create and update purchase orders.
* Read inventory adjustments.
* Read transporter contracts (shipping methods).

We provide an [OpenAPI specification file](https://developer.ongoingwarehouse.com/REST/v1/openapi.json) for our API. This is a machine-readable specification of the API, which allows you to automatically generate client code for your own programming language.
